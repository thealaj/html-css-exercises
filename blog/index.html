                                <p>I don't know about you, but I take comfort in that. It's good knowin' he's out there, the Dude, takin' her easy for all us sinners. Shit. I sure hope he makes The finals. Welp, that about does her, wraps her all up. Things seem to've worked out pretty good for the Dude'n Walter, and it was a purt good story, dontcha think? Made me laugh to beat the band. Parts, anyway. Course—I didn't like seein' Donny go. But then, happen to know that there's a little Lebowski on the way. I guess that's the way the whole durned human comedy keeps perpetuatin' itself, down through the generations, westward the wagons, across the sands a time until— aw, look at me, I'm ramblin' again. Wal, uh hope you folks enjoyed yourselves. Orci ipsum, placerat id condimentum rutrum, rhoncus ac lorem aliquam.</p>

                                <p>Lebowski ipsum hello! Do you speak English? Parla usted Inglese? I'll say it again. Did I urinate on your rug? Dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit praesent ac magna justo pellentesque ac lectus. Your "revolution" is over, Mr. Lebowski! Condolences! The bums lost! Quis elit blandit fringilla a ut turpis praesent felis ligula, malesuada suscipit malesuada non. Ever hear of the Seattle Seven? Ultrices non urna sed orci.</p>

                                <p>I spent most of my time occupying various, um, administration buildings, smoking thai-stick, breaking into the ROTC and bowling. Ipsum, placerat id condimentum. Listen, Maude, I'm sorry if your stepmother is a nympho. Rutrum, rhoncus ac lorem aliquam. JUST BECAUSE WE'RE BEREAVED DOESN'T MEAN WE'RE SAPS! Placerat posuere neque, at dignissim. I like your style, Dude. Magna ullamcorper in aliquam sagittis massa ac tortor ultrices faucibus curabitur.</p>

                                <p>Okay, Jackie, done. I like the way you do business. Your money is being held by a kid named Larry Sellers. He lives in North Hollywood, on Radford, near the In-and-Out Burger. A real fuckin' brat, but I'm sure. Eu mi sapien, ut ultricies ipsum morbi eget risus. Goddamnit Walter! You fucking asshole! Nulla nullam vel nisi enim, vel. You're just looking for a handout like every other. Are you employed, Mr. Lebowski? Auctor ante morbi id.</p>
